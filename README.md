# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

It is a simple, sorted time and task tracking application made by using React.JS. The styling is done with Tailwind and state management is done using Redux. 
The application let's us record task and time taken to complete the task. It has a stop watch and  a description section for tasks. The stopwatch work in basic manner with pause, start and save buttons while the task section records task name and description.
An Edit functionality for updating tasks is also provided.
